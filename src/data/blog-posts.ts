# What to Expect when Going onto Shopify

Shopify is a powerful platform, but it also comes with a lot of complexity if it is your first foray into ecommerce. We've put together this guide to help you understand what to expect.

Before you even start building, you'll need to:

- Define your product catalog structure
- Plan your collection organization

## The Build Phase

Once planning is complete, development begins:

1. **Theme Setup**: Custom theme development or theme customization

4. **Testing**: QA across devices and browsers

## The Launch Phase

Going live involves:

- Final QA and testing

# Why We Use Astro for Blazing-Fast Websites

At Snowdonia Studio, we're always looking for tools that help us deliver exceptional results for our clients faster. That's why we've embraced Astro as our go-to framework for modern website development.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a modern web framework designed for speed. It ships zero JavaScript by default, resulting in lightning-fast page loads and top-tier performance scores. But here's what makes it truly special: it's completely CMS-agnostic.

## Why Astro is Perfect for Client Projects

### Works with Any CMS

One of Astro's biggest advantages is its flexibility with content sources. We can connect it to:

- **WordPress**: Leverage your existing WordPress content via the REST API or GraphQL
- **Contentful**: Headless CMS for enterprise-grade content management
- **Sanity**: Structured content with real-time collaboration
- **Strapi**: Open-source headless CMS
- **Markdown/MDX**: Simple file-based content for smaller sites
- **Any headless CMS**: If it has an API, Astro can use it

This means if you're already invested in WordPress or another CMS, we don't force you to migrate. We simply build a faster, better frontend while keeping your familiar content workflow.

## Speed That Converts

Performance isn't just a nice-to-have—it directly impacts your bottom line:

- **Better SEO**: Google prioritizes fast-loading sites
- **Higher Conversions**: Every 100ms delay costs you conversions
- **Improved UX**: Users stay longer on fast sites
- **Mobile Performance**: Critical for mobile-first audiences

Astro's architecture ensures your site loads in milliseconds, not seconds.

## Faster Time to Market

Because Astro integrates seamlessly with existing CMSs and has a component-friendly architecture, we can:

1. **Rapid Prototyping**: Get designs into code quickly
2. **Reusable Components**: Build once, use everywhere
3. **Easy Content Migration**: Connect to your existing CMS without data migration
4. **Quick Deployments**: Modern deployment workflows with Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare

## WordPress + Astro: Best of Both Worlds

Many clients love WordPress for content management but hate the performance limitations. With Astro, you get:

- WordPress admin panel for content (familiar workflow)
- Lightning-fast Astro frontend (modern performance)
- No WordPress theme limitations (complete design freedom)
- Better security (decoupled architecture)
- Lower hosting costs (static deployment)

## Developer Experience = Better Client Outcomes

Astro's excellent developer experience means:

- Faster development cycles
- Fewer bugs
- Easier maintenance
- More time for polish and optimization

This translates directly to better outcomes for our clients: faster launches, lower costs, and higher quality.

## Real-World Results

Sites we've built with Astro consistently achieve:

- 100/100 Lighthouse performance scores
- Sub-second page loads
- Excellent Core Web Vitals
- Reduced hosting costs
- Happy clients

## When We Recommend Astro

Astro is perfect for:

- Marketing websites
- Blogs and content sites
- E-commerce with headless architecture
- Portfolio sites
- Documentation sites
- Any project where performance matters

## Not Just Another Framework

We chose Astro because it solves real problems for our clients: it's fast, flexible, works with their existing tools, and helps us deliver projects faster without compromising quality.
